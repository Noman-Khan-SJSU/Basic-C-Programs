// Find fibonacci using recursion.
// Any recursive program can be written in iterative as well, and vice versa is also true.
// Iterative is mostly better in performance than recursive but latter is more easier to
// write, maintain and understand. However, one may write a program in anyway for most practical purposes.
// Time Complexity: O(2^n) and Space Complexity: O(n) (because of the recursion tree).
